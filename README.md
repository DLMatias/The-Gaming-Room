# The-Gaming-Room
  The Gaming Room sought to expand the reach of their game "Draw It or Lose It" by developing a web-based version that would be accessible on multiple platforms, including desktop computers, tablets, and mobile devices. This new software required support for multiple teams, ensuring unique game and team names, and managing single instances of game play to maintain consistency across different platforms. This design documentation was thus developed to outline technical requirements and constraints, such as cross-platform compatibility and real-time multiplayer interactions, ensuring a structured approach to coding that was closely aligned with client expectations.

  Strengths of this documentation included a detailed domain model that clearly articulated the relationships and responsibilities within the game structure, and the use of design patterns like Singleton for managing game service instances. If a revision were necessary, enhancing the evaluation section to provide a more robust analysis of different operating platforms would be beneficial, ensuring the chosen platforms best meet the projectâ€™s technical and user requirements. Understanding and implementing user needs was key, involving translating core elements of the Android game to a web interface while keeping the user experience seamless and engaging. In future projects, employing user-centered design principles and iterative feedback could further enhance software design, ensuring it not only meets technical specifications but also user expectations for functionality and engagement.
